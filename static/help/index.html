                <ul>
                    <li>To allow researchers to express experiments as “templates” (abstract experiment workflow) and “executions” (implementations of experiment templates linked to specific experimental data sets).</li>
                    <li>To link experiments with their executions along with associated steps and artifacts and view them in an easy to understand format.</li>
                    <li>To provide a way for publishing experiment metadata using linked open data ontologies such as OPMW.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class='f3 tc'>Pre Questionnaire</h3>
                <p>The pre questionnaire will be used to filter participants into the evaluation task based on their research experience and to gauge familiarity with linked open data ontologies, sharing experiment workflows, and their documentation habits.</p>
                <p>It is used to understand the previous experience of the user in interacting with workflow and execution tools along with any knowledge of linked open data.</p>
                <p>The user’s academic qualification along with number of published experiments and their details such as whether the user was the main author and if it was a variation of some related experiment will be used to understand the user's experience in the field and the usefulness of the tools they have used previously in their research.</p>

                <h3 class='f3 tc'>Task 1: Search for similar or related experiments</h3>
                <video class="w-100 tc center" id="search-movie" src="/video/search.mp4" controls></video>
                <p>Given information about an experiment, the tasks is to search for experiments that match the search criterion.</p>
                <h4>Steps:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Enter or select the metadata in the tool.</li>
                    <li>Click Search</li>
                    <li>Browse through the results</li>
                    <li>Each result is an experiment template, and clicking on it will open the relevant documentation</li>
                </ol>
                <h3 class='f3 tc'>Task 2: Complete Experiment Execution</h3>
                <p>Given the selected experiment, you have to create an "execution" for the experiment.</p>
                <video class="w-100 tc center" id="search-movie" src="/video/execute.mp4" controls></video>
                <h4>Steps:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Enter the metadata for the experiment account.</li>
                    <li>Enter metadata for selected data set or step.</li>
                    <li>Publish the experiment account.</li>
                    <li>Navigate to the experiment documentation.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3 class='f3 tc'>Task 3: Create variation of experiment</h3>
                <video class="w-100 tc center" id="search-movie" src="/video/fork.mp4" controls></video>
                <p>Create a variation of the given experiment by changing a dataset or step, or adding new ones.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Enter metadata for the experiment variation.</li>
                    <li>Change dataset or step, add new data set or step</li>
                    <li>Publish the variation</li>
                    <li>Navigate to the experiment documentation.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3 class='f3 tc'>Post Questionnaire</h3>
                <p>The post usage questionnaire uses the System Usability Scale[3] to evaluate the usability of the browser based tool. It contains questions that will help evaluate the ease of using the tool, difficulty in understanding associated concepts, and relating to the user’s workflow . It also contains open ended questions based on the usefulness of the tool in their research and its publication.</p>
                <p>These questions will address the use of linked open data to define a reproducible experiment workflow, and the generated documentation by the tool. Questions related to how they currently document their experiments, whether they are reproducible and machine readable along with the perceived advantages/disadvantages of the browser based tool for generating documentation will also be addressed.</p>
                <p>At the end of the session, users will be encouraged to share their views and suggestions through a discussion about their area of research and how the tool can be incorporated.</p>
